Combiningtraditional mediumswith opera, dance, andprojection, she seeksout work that weavestogether the physicaland digital worlds. “Ilike the power that liveart has in forcing you toexperience something,to feel it emotionallyor physically,” saysSachs, who prefers towork unbound by institutionalstrictures.Her calling card has become techy, immersive work such as Virtually There, areinterpretation of Bauhaus master Oskar Schlemmer’sTriadisches Ballett that she codirected with Mafalda Milliesat Mana Contemporary last year.Now, from her duplex in the East Village (its closets concealpunchy vintage treasures alongside Reformation staples),her mission is expanding: Sachs has been named curator ofthe Lever House collection (where she is organizing a show of new work by Reginald Sylvester II) and artistic director of Spring Place, and serves on the board of the nonprofitPerforma. She is also prepping to take Virtually Thereon the road: first to Art Basel Miami Beach, then Expo Chicago,and, in 2019, on a world tour timed to the Bauhaus centennial.For Sachs, the future of art—no matter the genre—isinextricably tied to the experiential. “And that can includeanything,” she says. —JOHN ORTVED
