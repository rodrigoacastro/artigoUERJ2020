<MAGZ.VOGP.JANUARY.2017.0036><https://libgen.lc/magz/issue.php?n_id=3976166>< --- BEAUTY--->The Ingredient MANUKA HoneyHigh-tech formulas receive much of the buzz in beauty, but an ingredientwith a simpler origin story is stepping into the spotlight. New Zealand’smanuka honey, named for the flowering trees supplying its nectar, haslong been used by Maori healers and alt-wellness advocates to healwounds. Now, with a shift into mainstream medicine—recent studiesshow its antimicrobial effects even on antibiotic-resistant pathogens—comes a shift into mainstream beauty. This month, Kiehl’s joins thenatural movement with its manuka-powered, barrier-strengtheningPure Vitality Skin Renewing Cream. The ingredient also pops upin OY-L’s Exfoliating Manuka Mask, 001 Skincare London’s calmingSupreme Equilibrium treatment, and aesthetician Annee de Mamiel’scultish lip balm. The enzyme-rich raw honey earns its keep, too—asa purist’s salve (applied directly to skin) or a pantry swap for thoseswearing off refined sugar.—LAURA REGENSDORF
