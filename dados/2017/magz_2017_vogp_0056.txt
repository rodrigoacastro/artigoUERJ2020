This filter sets the tone of her new collaboration with Lululemon—eleven endlessly layerable workout separates, softly draped tanks and ballet-inspired wrap sweaters among them. The pieces come in a calming palette and offer a subversively subtle alternative to the reigning athleisure style. As Toomey sees it, the collection embodies the contradiction of the <tough-yet-tender><INTRA> Class itself. “We can be soft while also strong,” she says.—EVIANA HARTMAN
