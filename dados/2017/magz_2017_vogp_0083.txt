Slipping easily into the slipstream of the fashion and beauty worlds, Elsesser seemsto have outgrown the designation of model almost as quicklyas she came into it.A summer of working at breakneck speed has given way toa fall in which Paloma Elsesser collaborations seem inescapable:sneakers designed with Nike, a Planned Parenthoodcampaign with Proenza Schouler, and a nude-photographyproject for Glossier’s body wash and lotion, to name a few.Perhaps more important, the brands that want to work withher are seeking more than a pretty face; they are vying to enlistthe power of Elsesser’s voice. As her audience has grown,so has her stature as a role model of authenticity, inclusivity,body positivity, and female empowerment.Simply put, her time has come. “Companies now haveto reflect a level of texture, of anarchy, because people arebored any other way,” Elsesser says. “Without it, you’re justnot coming correct.”—SELBY DRUMMOND
