Take eighteen-year-old Princess Talita von Furstenberg,daughter of the charismatic Alexandra (herself one ofthe nineties swan-sister trio known collectively as the Millers)and granddaughter of the legendary designer and philanthropistDiane: Raised in Los Angeles, this year the blue-bloodeddarling of the Instagram generation attended her first Met galaand matriculated into Georgetown. Talita is quick, though, todownplay her ascendant status. “With social media, every girlis an It girl!” she says cheerfully, while her ever-evolving grandmothertakes stock of how the technology has fundamentally changed notions of accessibility—and responsibility. “It giveseveryone a platform to express themselves, hopefully forgood,” says Diane, who evolved the unquantifiable notion ofIt girl into more than a superfluous prefix: While her cheekboneswere surely among the most photographed of the1970s, her designs and namesake empire became sartorialsignifiers of women’s sexual liberation. “I fully lived every periodof my life,” she says, “so I guess I had an It life!” Beyondmere bloodlines, though, adventure unites the two. “WhatI love about Talita is her curiosity—she is both serious andfun,” says Diane. “I can’t deny that she reminds me so muchof myself.”—EMMA ELWICK-BATE
