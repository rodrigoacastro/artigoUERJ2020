<MAGZ.VOGP.JUNE.2017.0041>< https://libgen.lc/magz/issue.php?n_id=3976171>< ----------------------- TALKING FASHION ------- >Le Click!Le Bon Marché, with its iconic orange bags has beenunleashing shopping endorphins since it opened its RiveGauche doors in 1852, and this month the departmentstore, armed with the luxury might of the entire LVMHgroup, which owns it, launches a global shopping sitecalled 24 Sèvres to build on its legacy. In addition to BonMarché’s famed curation, 24 Sèvres will be stocking bothLouis Vuitton and Dior—two titans that have until nowbeen largely absent from the e-commerce space.The site (and a corresponding app) offers everything froma Laura Mercier compact ($75) to an Yves Salomon minkbomber ($13,000) with a singular focus. “We wanted to makethis visually based,” says Ian Rogers, LVMH’s chief digitalofficer, “with an elevated social-media presence.” (There’salso a team of Parisian fashion experts available via videochat: Imagine those decisive and believable ouis and nons.)A 75-piece capsule collection—which combines thetalents of 68 stocked maisons (including Chloé, ProenzaSchouler, Givenchy, and Prada) and contemporary Parisiancreatives—debuts just in time to celebrate the launch. Notethe art de vivre of Loewe’s hammock bag emblazoned withan illustration by Jonathan Anderson’s collaborators atthe creative agency M/M—or the Courrèges motocrossjacket adorned with a print by artist Chloe Wise.Rogers has given the nascent site an early test-drive,sending a PARISIENNE sweatshirt by Maison Kitsuné to hisdaughter in California. With such petits trésors now just a clickaway, now we will truly always have Paris.—EMMA ELWICK-BATES
