Just two years after landinga Meisel-lensed Italian Vogue shoot,she opened Chanel this season—withher mother, Cindy Crawford, cheeringand ’Gramming from the cascading-waterfallsidelines. The two are virtualposter children for our contemporaryculture’s blurring of once-defining notionsof age—though while Gerber hasinherited Mom’s unmistakable chestnutlocks, dark eyes, and lithe limbs, her palpablelove of the moment (and her self-awarenessabout both the power and thelimitations of the social-media lens) areall her own.—E.E.-B.
