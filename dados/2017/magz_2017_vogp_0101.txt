GLOBAL

Slick suiting,
punchy prints,
and TSA-friendly
footwear prove
that good style
always warrants
an upgrade.

The funny thing about
swimwear: The more
we’ve taken off, the more
we’ve dressed up.

WHEN WOMEN’S “BATHING DRESSES”
first appeared in the 1800s—as fulllength
gowns, complete with stockings
and sometimes garters—the
skirts were weighted at the trim so that
they wouldn’t float up and expose the
wearer’s legs. In the intervening century,
the swimsuit has both lightened
and lessened: One-piece offerings,
though not of the sleekly cut Eres type
found today, hit the American market
near the end of World War I, and the
groundbreaking bikini was first shown
in Paris in 1946.
Both the shrinkage and the skinbearing
engineering advancements
of swimwear—think Ava Gardner’s
hourglass-enhancing wartime twopiece
or Pamela Anderson’s hip-hooking
Baywatch lifeguard suit—are, of
course, tied to women’s attitudes toward
their bodies. It’s not necessarily a progression of things getting sexier
by the summer but, rather, silhouettes
and shapes reflecting the growing body
confidence—and the social acceptance
of same—as the decades have passed.
Still, the general rule of thumb is
paradoxical: The skimpier the suit, the
more highly designed they’ve tended
to be, having by now dived off the
runways of everyone from Chanel to
Hermès to Versace—where, for spring
2018, Donatella Versace unveiled a selection
of Trésor de la Mer maillots
de bain honoring one of fashion’s
most revered sun-seekers: her brother
Gianni. And as swimwear has evolved,
so has it expanded: Its purview now
includes sarongs (like the Michael Kors
piece seen, top right, on Kate Upton),
beach jewelry, and beach hats. Stop
by the Maldives or Bondi Beach this
winter, and you’ll see what we mean.
