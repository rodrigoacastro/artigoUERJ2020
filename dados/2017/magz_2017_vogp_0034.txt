Called Low-IntensitySteady State (LISS), the methodpromotes any type of cardio(walking, swimming, evencross-country skiing) that’snot done at full force. “LISS isgood for endurance—it helpsbuild up mitochondria in cellsand promotes oxygen delivery,”says Debora Warner, founderof New York City’s treadmillstudio Mile High Run Club. Abonus: “As you exercise for longperiods at about 60 percent ofyour maximal effort, that’s whenyou really start to burn fat,”confirms Michael Fredericson,M.D., a professor at StanfordUniversity’s School of Medicine.In other words, slow and steadywins this race.—MARISA MELTZER
