It anchors thismonth’s eight-piece line ofall-natural body-care andaromatherapeutic oils.2 Power Hour“There’s no reason youshould limit yourself toyoga just because you’repregnant,” says certifiedpre- and postnatalcorrective-exercisespecialist Joanie Johnson,explaining why shecofounded New York’sFPC. The new prenatalfitnessstudio focuses onspecific muscle groups toaid in labor and delivery fora strong, conditioned bodythroughout pregnancyand postpartum recovery.3 Get App-yFor all the stress, anxiety,doubt, and restlessnessaround fertility andmotherhood, there’sExpectful. The newsubscription-basedapp prescribes ten- to 20-minute guidedmeditations that help raiseemotional and physicalawareness so you canbetter connect with yourbody, your baby, and,most important, yourself.4 Click, Eat, LoveA new wave of mealdeliveryservices isdisrupting the $7 billionbaby-food industry. LittleSpoon, which just wentnational, features fresh,algorithm-driven organicfoodplans that providepediatrician-backednutrition for optimaldevelopment, not tomention “peace of mind—and extra time!” sayscofounder Lisa Barnett.5 Mix MasterPrioritizing your ownpostpartum nutritionis similarly essential.“It’s important to buildyourself up again,” saysherbalist Daniela Turley,who recommends SunPotion’s ashwagandha,the restorative Ayurvedicroot powder traditionallyserved to new mothersin India, blended withhoney—and hot goat’smilk. “It’s easy to digestand high in calcium andprotein!”—CELIA ELLENBERG
