Where you’dexpect to find a dangling diamond, a facetedcut of reclaimed Marupa or Louro Preto oakappears instead. Now she’s expanded herline to include decorative boxes that are justas beautiful as the treasures they’re madeto store. All use sustainably sourced woodsand feature geode clasps and supple suedelinings. “I picture a glamorous woman withkiller style keeping these at home,”Furmanovich says.—NOOR BRARA
