But what can rise to the level of art form, othertimes slips into outré exaggeration. “There is a fine line betweenreality and fantasy,” says Linda Cantello, Giorgio Armani Beauty’sinternational makeup artist, who believes that facial sculptingshould whisper rather than roar. “It’s comfort makeup,” she saysof the brand’s innovative new A-Line liquid pigments, featuring alightweight, water-based gel formula for contouring—a departurefrom the more familiar cream sculpting sticks that have made beautymoguls of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian West and Rihanna.The sheer matte fluid is available in two nearly universal shades (onewarm-toned, one cool), as well as five barely there blushes and twoshimmering highlighters. The line has a subversive appeal: nuance—acosmetic concept that is primed for a comeback.—CELIA ELLENBERG
