Everything in the lineis adjustable, and lots of the piecesare meant to hold you in a little bit.”McCartney is also the mother of four,including two girls, nine and ive—andthe notion that they might grow upbeing unhappy with their beautifulyoung bodies has made her especiallysensitive. “I want to arrive at a placewhere it’s all OK,” she says. “It’s aboutbeing healthy—and being amazing.”All of which doesn’t mean thatthe wearer of such things cannot befashion-forward—even fierce. “I wantthings to cross over—for girls loud andproud to wear, say, the leopard bra topout at night!” To help reach that noblegoal, each of the familiar and belovedStella signatures has been pressed intoservice: the iconic citrus print, animalspots, sportif stripes, color blocking,crochet, slick neoprene enlivened withmesh panels. These patterns are put tothe test in a range of friendly articles,from boy shorts to bandeaux to bikinis,triangle tops to side-tie briefs. Andof course everything is meant to bemixed—<who says giraffe spots can’t frolic with nautical stripes?><SENT>“I don’t like the word cover-up—<what is that word?><SENT>” McCartney thunders—and when you think about it,<isn’t there something a bit defeated, abit forlorn in those sad syllables?><INTER> 
<Not to worry><INTER>: <Whatever you wish to call them><SENT>, the pieces in the line include beach dresses both long and short,shirts, shorts, and the unromanticallynamed but indispensable rash guard.“I just want a cool beach uniform,”McCartney says with a sigh. “We haveto celebrate ourselves—even with ourinsecurities! Not that my swimwear isgoing to solve the world’s problems,but at least it can be something veryenjoyable.”—LYNN YAEGER
