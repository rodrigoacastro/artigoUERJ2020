By the time thecollection makes its final descentto stockists—includingModa Operandi, StevenAlan, and, most recently, thedesigner’s own boutique inBellport, New York—eachhighly saturated one-piece,bikini, and cover-up willhave clocked nearly25,000 miles. And tothink: That’s all beforeyou even stepinto a suit yourself.—RACHELWALDMAN
