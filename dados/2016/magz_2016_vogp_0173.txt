By Sarah Mower.<Exactly who are the culprits who kick-started the New Wave–y, Dynasty-tastic, monstershouldered vibe now strutting its utterly vulgar stuff around fashion?><SENT> <Offenders line up, please><INTER>.<I’d like to kiss you><INTER>. There is nothing quite as weirdas the megawatt electric shock of seeing the eighties beingfed back into the system—at least not if you’re old enoughto still have the horrors about the supposed crimes against taste committed in that decade. Iought to be one of them, having done power shoulders, golddoorknocker earrings, and white cone-heeled Maud Frizonlookalike pumps with the rest of the Voguettes back in theday. <Quelle horreur, then, to witness Hedi Slimane going out with an eighties flashback to giant shoulders, clingy minis, puffball skirts, and glitzy bows at Saint Laurent><SENT> There weresome women in the audience turning rigid. I slunk out beforeI had to speak to anyone. <Sorry><SENT>—but I loved it.This much I’ve come to recognize about fashion when it’son the turn: The second there’s a full-force parent-baiting frissonin the air, something unstoppable is about to run amok It’s always turbocharged when it’s about young people dressingup and having a ridiculous amount of fun—particularlyin times that are really not so much fun. Like now. 
<Why should girls and boys live by hoodies, sneakers, undone hair, and no makeup alone?><SENT> Collective fashion has to come up withuseful reasons to be, and cheering up is one of them. Streetutility is one way of being relevant; feeding the outrageouslyflashy party-and-dancing instinct is the other way—and it’sextra-specially useful when it annoys the grown-ups by makingthem feel, well, old. It’s healthy when a generation drawsa demarcation line between what they can wear and whatothers categorically, definitively, can’t, and it feels like a long time sincewe’ve—<I mean you’ve><SENT>—had that.<So bring it on, girls and boys><SENT>. 
<You absolutely should be parading about in out-there shoulders, metallic fabrics, and teeny draped dresses that your mothers have not witnessed since the heydays of Joan and Jackie Collins, Krystle Carrington, and Ivana Trump><SENT>.<Do run to Marc Jacobs’s resort collection for your gold lam. wrapped skirts, zebra-print jackets, and highwaist jeans><SENT>. 
<Do raid our wardrobes (and thrift shops) for the tacky unwearables middle-aged women have spent 30 years distancing themselves from!><SENT>The cordon sanitaire of elapsed timeensures that a new generation is comingto this unprejudiced. In any case, theeighties look in 2016 is more a questionof reappropriating the silhouette—wide shoulders, streamlined shapes,shoes and thigh-high boots with pinthinheels—configurations we didn’tactually wear while dancing to RobertPalmer at Area in 1985.Forensic examination shows that theshoulder volumes at Kenzo, Gucci, andPrada have a kind of drooping, slopingincline—the width is added where thesleeves puff. That one’s never happenedbefore. Girls might—. la Miuccia—also choose to pair one of those roomyjackets with just a pair of argyle tights.<Who knows how everything will settle down into a set of rules—if at all?><SENT> Fashionis constantly experimenting withwhat goes with what and changing atthe speed of Snapchat.I’d say the proportions have beentriggered, in part, by the oversize jacketsbrought back by Demna Gvasalia(born 1981) at Vetements via MartinMargiela, though that’s a nineties reference.JW Anderson (born 1984) had adefinite hand in it, too, with his gargantuanleg-of-mutton sleeves for spring2016, a wild hybrid of eighties PrincessDiana and Vivienne Westwood piratesquiggleprint—one of those shocksthat switch fashion sensibilities to anew channel. It’s evolving, though, onthe streets—where it’s been the year ofcropped tops and high-waisted, gatheredpants. To misquote the deathless1984 ZZ Top hit, it’s got legs. <No?><INTER> 
<Oh,go on><INTER>—<find it on YouTube><INTER>. There’s awhole video’s worth of inspiration forsomeone.
