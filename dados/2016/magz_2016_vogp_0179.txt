Her latest venturecombines both interests into an elevated collectionof shave products offering an alternative to pink plasticfor like-minded aesthetes. Mave, her six-piece grooming ritual,is built around a custom razor with a sculptural, <easy-to-grip><INTRA>white resin handle that bears a striking resemblance to Brancusi’smarble Bird in Space. While the design celebrates form, theblade is all industry-tested function: After considerable marketresearch, Newman manufactured her razor to fit Gillette Venusheads, which she buys in bulk and handsomely repackagesin slide-top paper boxes (at no extra cost), effectively bypassingthe locked cases at the drugstore. Just as much thought went intothe range’s chamomile-laced exfoliant, a body oil with soothingarnica and aloe, and a shave cream that owes its decadent latherto a gentle coconut-derived surfactant. Each one comes delicatelyscented with Fleur Cardamom, a tea-inspired essential-oil blendalso available as an eau de parfum. Even the British-style shavingbrush features cruelty-free synthetic bristles that mimic classicbadger. It’s all part of a larger mission Newman traces backto graduate school. “I did my thesis on the Russian ConstructivistVladimir Tatlin and his work with everyday objects, trying to makethem more beautiful,” she reveals—which might explain herexpertise on the subject. mavenewyork.com.—LAURA REGENSDORF
