Thefragrance designer branched out intoleather goods in February, just a fewmonths before opening his New Yorkflagship store in SoHo. And the tall,heavily inked Swede isn’t done yet. Forhis brand’s first charitable initiative,Gorham has teamed up with FrejaBeha Erichsen on a woodsyTurkish-rose eau inspired by theDanish supermodel and her work withthe nonprofit group Doctors WithoutBorders. Five percent of the scent’snet revenues will go to the globalorganization, which dispatcheshumanitarian aid and health care tothose who need it most. Called Roseof No Man’s Land, the perfume takesits name from one of Gorham’stattoos—a cross bearing the sameinscription, with a nurse and the titularbloom in the center—which was apopular way for soldiers in world warsto honor the field nurses who savedtheir lives. Says Gorham, “It’s nice tobe able to contribute to people whoare doing important work.” $145;byredo.com.—CELIA ELLENBERG
