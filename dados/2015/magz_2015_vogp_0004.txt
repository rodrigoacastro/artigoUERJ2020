Rather than familiar flower namesor signature numbers that can dictate how we perceiveperfume, the ten unisex eaux in Prada’s new Olfactoriesrange are named for pop songs and movies of decades past,selected as triggers for the imagination. Some—like theMotown hit “Heat Wave” or the New Wave single “TaintedLove”—come with immediate, emotion-conjuring recognition;while others, like “Nue au Soleil,” the title of a forgotten (tomost of us) Brigitte Bardot hit from 1970, may take a littlemore detective work. What exactly you’re smelling may, too.Andrier is deliberately evasive about what notes areincluded in each watercolor-hued offering as a means ofleaving that decision up to the wearer. “The most beautifulidea in this age of overinformation is that [fragrance]should be left to everyone’s personal description,” shedeadpans. “It smells like what you find it smells like.”Still, you wouldn’t be wrong in picking up a whiff ofincense alongside that iris in Purple Rain. The lipstick notein Tainted Love is also hard to miss, as is a twist of orangeblossom lurking in the exotic and earthy Nue au Soleil.Coordinating graphic silk pouches pulled from the Pradaarchive provide another tactile clue to each perfumepuzzle, an evasiveness that pays off in the bottles’ abilityto transcend a mere spritz behind the ear. Instead, theyland somewhere more ineffable where personal memoryresides. “That makes [them] meaningful,” Andrierelaborates. “Not just another trend.”—JEAN NATHAN
